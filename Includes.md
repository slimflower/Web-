# DESCRIBE
- Can you get the flag?
- Go to this website and see what you can discover.
- ***Hints***: Is there more code than what the inspector initially shows?
# SOLUTION
- When we access the link we will see an introduction to Includes. Our job is to find the flag hidden inside.
- We will see two files with the extension .css and .js. Let's check to see if those two files contain a hidden flag inside or not.
- When we look at the .css file, we will see the flag we are looking for with the line `/*  picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_  */`.
- So again the flag will be in the .js file `//  f7w_2of2_df589022}`
- Flag: picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_f7w_2of2_df589022}.
